#### SF Movie Map 

To get started, I exported the available dataset from [SF Data](https://data.sfgov.org/Arts-Culture-and-Recreation-/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am) to a JSON file, [data.json](https://github.com/khennes/sf-movie-map/blob/master/static/js/data.json), then ran it through a script, [geocode.py](https://github.com/khennes/sf-movie-map/blob/master/geocode.py), that geocoded each object's location string and added a new property for lat/long coordinates to it. The updated array, [geocoded.json](https://github.com/khennes/sf-movie-map/blob/master/static/js/geocoded.json), is loaded onto the client via a `$.getJSON` call. (I chose to use a JSON in/out API for simplicity's sake, but if I were expecting dynamic input from users, or if the dataset were going to grow much larger, I would have used a SQL database instead.)

The geocoding script took several passes to successfully handle all of the data. Using the [PyGeocoder](http://code.xster.net/pygeocoder/wiki/Home) wrapper to issue requests to the Google Geocoding API from the server side, I biased the results to a small area of SF using [this handy tool](http://jsfiddle.net/yV6xv/16/) to identify the coordinates. At first, about half of the location strings returned irrelevant or zero results during the first run-throughs of the geocode.py script. To debug the problem, I printed the failing strings to a separate text file, skimmed through it, and identified a few patterns that I could intercept through error handling. (The character Ã©, for instance, caused some errors, as did - surprisingly - several landmarks like City Hall and the Bay Bridge.)

On the other side, the frontend uses the Google Maps API, jQuery, Underscore.js, and Backbone.js, as well as Twitter's [typeahead.js](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) library for text field autocompletion. The user can filter the view by movie title, director, and/or year. The entire frontend is organized with Backbone and is composed of a single Model, two Collections, and a View; after loading the data from the server, [main.js](https://github.com/khennes/sf-movie-map/blob/master/static/js/main.js) loops through the JSON array and creates both a Google Maps marker and a Backbone Model (also 'marker') for each object. 

Previous experience with this stack: This was the first thing I've built with jQuery, Backbone.js (which I learned to complete this challenge), Underscore.js, and the Google Maps API. It's also my first experience with the Mocha/Chai testing framework.

Areas for improvement: Among other things, I would like the user to be able to filter the view by location (eg, by typing in an address, landmark, or intersection). I'd most likely implement this by populating the typeahead.js menu with results from the Google Places API, then filtering the view to include movies filmed within a specific radius of the (geocoded) query. I'd also like for the user to be able to display multiple filters of the same type and close them individually. (Note: This project has not been tested in IE.)
